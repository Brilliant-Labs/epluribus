    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>The rise in popularity of desktop 3D printing and 3D scanning has made it possible for tech-savvy tourists to travel the globe, bringing home digital mementos of their trip, recreated as tiny plastic miniatures.</p>

    <p>But why stop at trinkets when you can replicate the original in its entirety?</p>
    
    <p>At the <a href="http://articles.thewalters.org/artbytes2014/">ArtBytes Hackathon</a> at the <a href="http://thewalters.org/default.aspx">Walters Art Museum</a>, our team set out to recreate a full 1:1 scale replica of a prominent work of Baltimore public art. Giuseppe Ceracchi's strange neoclassical "Bust of George Washington" (1791-1792) is currently on display at the Walters during the restoration of Baltimore's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument_(Baltimore)">Washington Monument</a>.</p> 
    
    <blockquote>
    — "Friend, surely this statue is too large to produce on a desktop 3D printer?"<br>
    — "But weren't the pyramids built in pieces, block-by-block?" 
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>We face your challenges, unafraid! Working from a micron-resolution professional 3D scan of the statue donated by <a href="http://www.dirdim.com/">Direct Dimensions</a>, we have sliced and diced the model into 110 easy-to-print sections, each cleaned up and oriented for your printing pleasure. Now we need your help to crowdsource the printing of this monument, a cube at a time, and ship back your contributions to the museum where they will be reunited, stacked and glued into a new replica of a copy of a bust by Giuseppe Ceracchi. We expect that results of this distributed effort will be a monumental (if monstrous) work of art in itself!</p>

<li><a href="<%= user_omniauth_authorize_path(:google_oauth2) %>">Sign in with your Google+ account</a></li>
<li>Commit to a project. You will get assigned a new block to print</li>
<li>Print your given block within 1 week. You have the option to print in whatever color you want, and to inscribe your initials on a non-visable face of your block</li>
<li>Verify that you have printed your block by uploading a photo of your printed block</li>
<li>Your print will be verified within 48 hours, and you will receive an address to mail your block</li>
<li>When all blocks for a project have been completed, they will be glued and assembled to present next to the original statue! Your name will appear here on the website as a valued contributor to the project!</li>
