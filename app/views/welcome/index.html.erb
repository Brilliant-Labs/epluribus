  <h2 style="margin-top: 5px;">About We the Builders</h2>
  <p>We the Builders was created as part of the <a href="http://articles.thewalters.org/artbytes2014/">ArtBytes Hackathon</a> at the <a href="http://thewalters.org/default.aspx">Walters Art Museum</a>. Our team set out to recreate a full 1:1 scale replica of a prominent work of Baltimore public art using 3D printing. We didn't have enough printers to do it all ourselves, so we built this crowdsourcing platform!</p>
